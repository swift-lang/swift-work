= Python Parallel: mpi4py in Swift/T

== Installation

. Install an Anaconda installation
. Install Anaconda package `mpi4py`
. Install Swift/T with that Anaconda installation as the Python +
  Use `swift-t-settings.sh:PYTHON_EXE`

== Examples

=== Test 1

----
$ swift-t -n 6 test-1.swift
----

. This test workflow loads and runs a simple Python module called `test_1`.
. The workflow calls `python_parallel_persist()` with some Python code, and expects to receive a string result.
. `test_1` has 1 function, `f()`
. `test_1.f()`
.. uses `mpi4py` and `turbine_helpers` to access the communicator created by Swift/T for the task, and obtain its `rank`
.. reports its rank with the communicator size
.. returns `"HELLO"` to Swift/T
. The workflow prints the result `"HELLO"` from the Python level.
